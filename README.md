# Introduction
Welcome to my ETL Pipeline Project Readme! This project is a demonstration of my skills in data wrangling, cleaning, and transforming. The goal of this project was to create an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to prepare a dataset for analysis. The dataset used in this project contains information about video games sales from various regions of the world.

In this project, I extracted data from two separate CSV files, cleaned and transformed the data, and loaded the data into a PostgreSQL database. I used Python and its libraries Pandas and Psycopg2 to complete the project.

# What I learned
During this project, I learned how to effectively clean and transform data using Pandas. I also learned how to use SQL commands to create tables and insert data into a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, I learned how to work with two separate datasets and join them together based on common columns.

Overall, this project allowed me to showcase my data wrangling and data analysis skills. It also demonstrated my ability to work with SQL databases and connect them with Python. Thank you for taking the time to review my project!
